Sailing

Oh, how I dream of sailing
Across the deep blue sea
On warm days where the sun is shining
With a gentle breeze

Oh, how I dream of sailing
On nights where skies are clear
With the stars and moon all shining
Guiding me to mooring pier

Oh, how I dream of sailing
On cold and stormy days
With rain and thunder and lightning
The boat crashing through waves

Oh, how I dream of sailing
While watching the sunrise
With all the dolphins swimming
And seagulls in the skies
